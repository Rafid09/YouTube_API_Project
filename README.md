# Extracting YouTube Data with Python Using API

API is short for Application Programming Interface and it is a software interface that allows programmers to have an efficient way for client-server communication.

We will be using the YouTube API with the help of Python programming. By doing so we will be able to extract and scrap data from YouTube which could be used in multiple projects.

## To get started the followings are required to install:

* You may use PyCharm or VSCode to start the project.

* **For Windows:**
  * *pip install google-api-python-client*

* **For Ubuntu:**
  * *sudo pip install google-api-python-client*

* **For Anaconda:**
  * *conda install google-api-python-client*

* **You'll need Libraries to work upon your YouTube API extraction. Use this code:**
  * *from googleapiclient.discovery import build*
